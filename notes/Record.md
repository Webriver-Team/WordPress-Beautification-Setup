# Beautification Processes Record

* TODO:
* [ ] Check if indent Size conflicts for each type of file after Extensions are enabled and other linting is added from external sources like phpcbf.
* [ ] Check if MD files have no trailing whitespace after Extensions are enabled and other linting is added from external sources.
* [ ] Check if all files have Linux based LF line endings not CRLF windows based line endings. Manages at 2 places EditorConfig and VSCode settings ("files.eol": "\n",)
